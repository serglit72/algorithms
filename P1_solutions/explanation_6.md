**Intersection** = only common elements in two sets
I've implemented a **set()** as a middle array to get a set of common values of these two linked lists or all elements from both sets. And then I've created a new linked list from the set. 

**union** = all elements from both set with no duplicates

Time complexity - **O(3nlog(n))**
