I have implemented the blockchain simple algorithm based on two classes Block() and Chain() as **singly-linked list**  data structure with O(n). But I have implemented time complexity O(1) by referencing to the last block (tail) and connecting the next block to the tail without traversing the whole linked list from the head.

Time complexity - **O(1)**
Space complexity - **O(n)**
